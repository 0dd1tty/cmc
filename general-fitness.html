            <p>For the individual whose goal is to take their fitness ability in CrossFit to a higher level.  This class is structured to create a higher level of fitness ability then the general CrossFit class.  An individual in this program wishes to compete in the sport of CrossFit through competitions or other CrossFit events offered to the entire country, or also just very much enjoys in fitness.  This class is structured 
            longer, a two hour class instead of one hour class, due to the amount of training required to reach a higher potential.</p>

These individuals could be seeking this style of fitness for various reasons like coming back from an injury, having constant pain in some part of their body, no enjoyment of weightlifting, or enjoyment of these physical workouts.  These workouts consist of body weight assisted movements, rowing, biking, 
            exercise cardiovascular machines, or any other type of low intensity exercise/movement.</p>

These workouts would consist of: kettlebells, medicine balls, sled pushing, body weight exercises, 
                    pulling exercises, and other total body exercises.  This is a good beginner’s progression into a heavier type Burn training.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Heavy Burn: </strong>Moderate to Heavy weight, cardiovascular training, and high intensity for shorter periods of time.  The purpose of this program is to perform more technically difficult exercises and be a more vigorous type of strength and conditioning training for further advanced members.
