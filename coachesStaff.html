        <h1>Coaches/Staff</h1>
        <h2>Tony Harrison, CSCS, RSCC, USAW, CF-L1</h2>
        <p>Tony brings to the organization 11 years of experience across all levels of age, fitness level, and fitness goal.  In these 11 years, Tony has not only developed his education in the field, 
            but also gained 11 years of experience in coaching, and as well as gaining a reputation in the community for developing athletes and improving the health of individuals.  He possesses the skills,
             knowledge, and research into the programming and coaching of the clients.  Tony has developed his professional career in this area because of his background.  In high school, Tony encountered 
             numerous substantial injuries that ultimately stopped his participation in sports and dream of making it to the collegiate level athletically.  This fueled his passion for strength and conditioning 
             not only because of its role in athletic development but also injury prevention.  He has not only helped his athletes increase their performance, but also he has helped athletes recover from injury 
             and specifically help for injury prevention.  </p>
        <p>Tony has been the Assistant Strength and Conditioning Coach at CSU-Pueblo since 2009.  He has been the strength and conditioning coach for football, men’s and women’s soccer, baseball, softball, men’s 
            lacrosse, volleyball, men’s & women’s golf, men’s and women’s track and field, men’s and women’s cross country, wrestling, men’s basketball, and men’s and women’s tennis.  The professional expertise 
            that he has provided the Colorado State University-Pueblo athletic teams has contributed to their national Division II rankings.  Since Tony’s tenure at CSU-Pueblo, he has been part of eleven RMAC 
            Championships and one National Championship.  Also, Tony has trained many athletes earning All-Conference, All American, and National Champion honors (individual honors).  Throughout his professional 
            career, Tony has worked with a wide variety of athletes ranging in ages from eight years old to All-American and Professional athletes.</p>
        <p>His vision expanded from just trying to help athletes achieve their athletic goals to being passionate about helping improve the daily health of regular, non-athletic individuals.  Tony has witnessed 
            firsthand how many everyday people need help improving their quality of life and learning about the fitness industry.  Tony has been able to work with individuals ranging primarily from 40s to 70s and also 
            others ranging from teens to individuals in their 30s.  These individuals also came from a wide range of health and fitness backgrounds.  To be able to help an individual with tasks in their everyday life, 
            like getting up and down from the couch or picking things up from the ground, is just as rewarding to Tony as winning a national championship.</p>
