            <h2>Yoga</h2>
            <p>This class offered is a total mind-body workout that has many physical and mental benefits.  Some of the physical benefits of yoga are increased flexibility, increased muscle strength and tone, improved respiration/energy/vitality, maintaining a balanced metabolism, weight reduction, cardio and circulatory health, improved athletic performance, and protection from injury (The Benefits of Yoga 2017).  Yoga is also very beneficial for individual’s 
            mental health.  Yoga is known to help an individual manage stress which not only helps an individual’s outlook on life but can help with neck pain, sleeping problems, and headaches caused by stress.  Mental well-being is also improved from meditation and breathing that is incorporated by yoga.  The Colorado Movement Company will offer yoga classes in the gym and hire yoga instructors to teach classes.  This is a unique service that will be offered 
            because you do not have to be a member to attend a yoga class.  Yoga will be included in the membership for a member, but if one is not a member, they can attend the class for $5.  This class is structured uniquely this way for a couple of reasons.  This class offered is a low risk type of exercise and with a certified yoga instructor, this class is completely safe for any fitness level.  Colorado Movement Company sees two benefits from this structure, 
            the first being additional revenue from non-members attending class.  More beneficially, there is great marketing potential for non-members to eventually join the company and become a member. </p>
